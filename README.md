# TeaSupTool
Teaching support tools

This is just a side project for small Python code tools or Jupyter Notebooks 
that may make some repetitive tasks a bit easier for me.
Maybe someone else can profit from it too. 

The first (and hopefully not the last) contribution is a Jupyter Notebook that I'll use to enter 
my multiple choice questions (currently all in Word documents) into a text format that Blackboard 
can import. 

**Background**: I just finished preparing for the mid-term exam when all classes were called off. 
So now I need to get the exams question online. but converting multiple choice questions
from a word document into Blackboard content seems to be a tedious click and drop with 
copy/paste. The other option is to put the question and answers into a spreadsheet table 
(a plain text with tabs). Since neither option looked too exciting to me, I wanted to get
a little Python support for myself to start the process of putting my quizzes, and at least
the bulk of multiple choice questions eventually into Blackboard. The Corona virus outbreak
was the trigger event for what was a long overdue task, anyways.
